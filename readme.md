# Music Theory SDK

This is a toolkit for note/chord/set parsing, transposition, and enumeration.

This repository is under active development, and the interface should be considered *extremely* unstable. Development help is welcome!

## Classes

This library is built in an object-oriented manner for organization alone, but is mostly functional. All methods are static and flexible.

## API documentation will appear as the interface matures and solidifies.
